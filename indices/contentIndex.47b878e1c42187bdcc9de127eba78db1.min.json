Then they have to spend more money (even beyond the initial marketing budget) cleaning up the mess made by an inexperienced team.\n\n##### When it comes to visuals, cheap costs more.¬†\n\nMost developers know this. But it‚Äôs difficult to choose the higher quality option when comparing budget and profit margins. Rarely do they make the correct decision preemptively.¬†\n\nBut what if you literally have NO other options? What if you *have* to go with a ‚Äúlow budget?‚Äù\n\nWhile I believe ALL campaigns should return an ample ROI (thus justifying the higher initial investment in a better firm), I also understand that funds may still be scarce and time sparse¬† ‚Äî so sometimes you have to make the best with what you got.\n\nIn that case, consider these points when hiring and managing a creative team for the visuals in your marketing campaign.¬†\n\n#### Quality over quantity.\n\nClich√©d? Yes. But still‚Ä¶\n\nA premium perception of your development should be the priority. Your ROI will increase by orchestrating two exceptional images rather than ten average images. (Although usually, they end up far below average.)\n\nThe goal is cohesion. No one looks at a single image and decides to buy. They look at the campaign as a whole and buy based on their feeling, which impacts their perception.\n\nAnything below that premium perception of your development - even a single image - will destroy the feel of your building in the marketing materials. A quality visual storefront for your development creates the perception that the building will also be quality.\n\nConversely, when someone looks at cheap marketing materials, they will wonder where else the developer cut corners.\n\nIf you need to show more spaces, then:\n\n#### Depict a clear message.\n\nDevelopers often fall into the trap of ‚Äúmore is better,‚Äù cramming as much as possible into each view. It creates the opposite effect of its intention.\n\nBusy images confuse the viewer with their lack of purpose. The viewer doesn‚Äôt know what they are supposed to look at, so information gets lost.\n\nFor example, imagine a commercial office space interior. Are you trying to show a client‚Äôs experience walking and getting a good impression of the company? Are you trying to show the technical features of the space? Are you trying to show the internal culture? You can‚Äôt have all three AND a compelling view.\n\nBy showing more, you reveal less.\n\nEach view needs a purpose within the entire campaign.\n\nIf you have a large space requiring more views, then instead:\n\n#### Utilize close-ups.\n\nYou can save money by reducing the content depicted in the scene.\n\nRather than display the entire caf√© within an office space, take a close-up of just the kitchenette. Capture the feeling of someone about to enjoy a fresh cup of coffee right before work - the warm sunrise beaming through, the crisp aroma of freshly ground beans, and the tranquil moment before a zestful day of work.\n\nPeople buy based on emotion, not features.\n\nEvoke emotions more effectively through a smaller, more inexpensive view.\n\nYou can then utilize this technique to:\n\n#### Ensure image utilization.\n\nAre you familiar with the difference between image quality and image utilization in a marketing campaign? They serve different purposes.\n\nA single, high-quality exterior rendering of the entire building may look nice initially, but it may not fit cohesively on your project‚Äôs homepage or marketing brochure. Typically, you would request a separate view. But if you want to save money while maintaining quality, choose a view that you know will work in ALL consumer touchpoints - e.g., a close-up of the building's fa√ßade or a key architectural feature.\n\nYour marketing materials can then use cropped, zoomed-in, or overlay text on these images without losing its message. It also makes for a powerful intro that sparks the viewer‚Äôs curiosity, hooking them into viewing more.\n\nEnsure this is done preemptively within the initial strategic overview to save the most time, and get the highest ROI.\n\n‚Äç\n\n##### At the end of the day, IF you have to go cheap, concentrate your resources toward a single goal to maximize the value of your visual marketing campaign.\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T14:08:05.997902981Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Problems-With-Using-An-In-house-Team":{"title":"The Problems With Using An In-house Team","content":"\n*Created*: *2023-03-10*\n*Version*: 1.00\n\n---\n\n**The key differences between an in-house creative department and a design firm.**\n\n---\n\nAfter studying over one thousand developments and speaking with over 100 developers, the evidence is clear.\n\nAn in-house creative department for architectural marketing campaigns ensures a quick route to mediocrity, reducing sales.¬†\n\nYet most developers still opt for an in-house creative department. They tend to believe it either saves time and money, or they‚Äôll get a better visual at the end.¬†\n\nThe reality? Neither of these happen.¬†\n\nDesign agencies specialize in niches, which produces a greater incentive to produce better results. I will cover why this happens and the difference between in-house creative departments and specialist design agencies.¬†\n\n## INCENTIVE STRUCTURE\n\n### In-house\n\n**In-house departments have no inherent incentive to grow.**\n\nCreatives on an in-house team focus on abiding by the directions of the firm in which they work.¬†\n\nSurvival and maintenance of the existing structure become the principal obligation. Phrases like ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt rock the boat‚Äù or ‚ÄúThis is the way we do things here‚Äù squash any creativity, ambition, and innovation that new team members might have brought to the project.¬†\n\nWhat‚Äôs the point of moving beyond survival if no intrinsic rewards exist?¬†\n\nPersonal growth means more work for the same pay.¬†\n\nAs such, their systems tend to be outdated and inferior. Something particularly concerning given our society‚Äôs current rate of technological advancement.¬†\n\nThere are a few by-products of this phenomenon:¬†\n\n* Failure to accurately diagnose the developers‚Äô problems\n* Higher prices for work below industry standards\n* Inability to solve problems beyond the immediate project scope or expertise\n\nBy the way, that inability to solve problems beyond the creative‚Äôs immediate scope of work often hamstrings the entire project's success.¬†\n\nTo diminish incentives even further, sub-par work has almost no consequences for the architectural firm. Developers will still work with the architect even if their in-house visual team creates marketing material that looks like something rendered from 30-year-old CG software.¬†\n\nIn short, the reputation of the architectural firm protects the in-house team. The developer may not like the marketing material, but they don't want to risk the deal with a top-tier architecture firm.¬†\n\nThis further exacerbates the inherent complacency of the in-house creative departments. It‚Äôs a shame, really.¬†\n\n### Design Firms\n\n**The marketplace rewards design firms for exceptional results.**\n\nThe better their results, the more they grow.¬†\n\nDesign firms feel the rewards of a successful project. They become tangible reminders that rewards create an inherent imperative toward growth.¬†\n\nA design firm exists to create and grow. That simply won‚Äôt happen if they don‚Äôt put their clients first and consistently solve their clients‚Äô problems with speed and a clear ROI.¬†\n\nThe tangible rewards of success incentivize design first to invest in superior, modern systems that can accommodate the challenges of our times.¬†\n\nPlus, the design firm and every single team member risks more since they operate in the open market.¬†\n\n## PROJECT EXECUTION\n\n### In-house\n\n**In-house departments prioritize the needs of the firm they reside in over the developer.**\n\nThe existing structure results in teams operating as **executors** who simply take orders from developers or their superiors. (And I have yet to find an industry that doesn't joke about managers with no specialty in the skills of the team they manage - in this case, marketing, branding, or computer graphics.)\n\nCreative executors fail to hit the *real* objectives because they aren‚Äôt expected (or rewarded) for diagnosing the *needs* (not wants) of the developer.¬†\n\nImagine a doctor prescribing you medication without taking the necessary precautions and asking you the right questions - let alone blindly trusting you when you say you want the medication from some commercial or what your friend liked. Yet, we allow creative teams this leeway when so many more lives depend on the success of the development.\n\n*In-house teams commit creative malpractice by blindly executing what their non-creative manager says they want.*¬†\n\nAnd just like (some) doctors, they will prioritize their own needs (profit and prescribing you a medication to meet a quota) over what's best for you. They focus on THEIR architectural features - rather than what‚Äôs best for a successful marketing campaign for the project. Granted, certain architectural features may help a campaign but will *not* increase the value of your development all by themselves.¬†\n\n### Design Firms\n\n**Design firms, by nature, must solve the needs of their developer directly.**¬†\n\nThey cannot exist in any other capacity and survive.¬†\n\nUnlike the in-house team, they work directly with YOU - no middleman, no incentive difference among shareholders.¬†\n\nA design firm must increase the value of your development *because that lets them keep the privilege of your business.*¬†\n\nIncreasing development value lets the design firm thrive in the open marketplace. Unlike the in-house team, they don‚Äôt work in a vacuum. Mistakes mean loss of business, and exceptional performance means tangible rewards.¬†\n\nThe inherent structural dynamic incentivizes the design firm to operate as **strategists** rather than executors. They take the reins as orchestrators, which allows you to be the owners you're supposed to be.\n\nDeep marketing strategy understanding increases the value of the development more than any other marketing benefit.¬†\n\n## **TALENT**\n\n### In-house\n\n**In-house departments have a difficult time attracting talent specific to that domain.**\n\nSpecialists know they have a marketable skill and take those skills to places that will reward them. That‚Äôs why they work for specialist firms.¬†\n\nIn-house teams save payroll by hiring generalists, student interns, or someone who does design and visuals *on the side*. Regardless of their background, the department manager might have an MBA but lacks practical knowledge of what makes a development sell.¬†\n\nThis works well for the architectural firm that can rely on the reputation of their architects. But it doesn‚Äôt benefit the developer.¬†\n\n### Design Firms\n\n**Highly specialized design firms attract highly specialized talent.**\n\nFor exactly that reason, developers typically work with a series of specialists, as opposed to one generalist.¬†\n\nPeople would rather be part of a firm that specializes in their area of interest rather than work in a small branch of a firm that does something else. When someone dedicates their life toward mastering a specific skill, they naturally gravitate to an organization that puts that skill (and themselves) as a priority.¬†\n\nPriority in specialization supports the specialist in increasing their skills, earning rewards for that dedication and providing a sense of fulfillment.¬†\n\nIt‚Äôs only natural for skilled creatives to opt for a specialty design firm.¬†\n‚Äç\n\n---\n\n##### **Like the creatives, developers opting for a specialized design firm will realize the same benefits because when accounts get tallied, in-house departments have no obligation to the reality of the market.**\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T14:08:05.997902981Z","tags":null},"/notes/The-Top-Questions-Developers-Must-Ask":{"title":"The Top Questions Developers Must Ask","content":"\n*Created*: *2023-03-10*\n*Version*: 1.00\n\n---\n\nThe best way to avoid a failed campaign is to prevent it.\n\nIt starts with picking the right firm.¬†\n\nMost creative firms have *no idea* how the development process actually works. They rarely ask what role they play in the bigger picture. Still, many developers pick their creative firms based on perception rather than logic. That primarily stems from a lack of understanding of exactly what to look for and why.¬†\n\nThis article gives you the framework to sort the good from the bad firms so you can have the most successful campaign possible.¬†\n\nNote: Stick to the questions in order. They build off of one another, so if you get a ‚Äúweak‚Äù answer early on, moving on to another firm will save you time.\n\n#### 1. HOW¬†WILL¬†YOUR¬†SERVICE¬†INCREASE¬†PROFIT?\n\nFrom the outside, it may seem like it's an obvious and natural topic to discuss ‚Äî especially if you come from the business world.\n\nHowever, in the creative world, creatives have challenges with the stigma around money. While the professionals who make careers in marketing move past it, a lack of comfort discussing profits indicates their level of experience (and likely competency) within the industry.¬†\n\n##### Qualities of a weak answer:\n\n* Uncomfortable speaking about money.\n\nThose who have money have no problems speaking about it - and if they have money, they must be a successful firm. That‚Äôs the compensation for the value they provide to the marketplace.\n\n* Will defer to quality.\n\nGenerally, a firm that answers questions about profit with quality will give you nothing but execution. Execution alone does not make a successful campaign. Most anyone can execute an idea. The work itself does not increase the profitability of your project.\n\n##### Qualities of a strong answer:\n\n* They can show you past results\n\nAny good firm knows *exactly* how they produce results within the bigger picture of a project. They likely built their service *directly* upon those results - rather than on quality alone.\n\n#### **2. HOW WILL YOUR SERVICE SAVE US TIME?**\n\nThis question looks for the processes the firm has in place to make the service more effective for YOU. This can be through specific communication systems, review systems, and reports.¬†\n\nE.g. Will they reduce meeting times? Will they make it easier for your to communicate with other shareholders?\n\nThese processes and procedures should back up the results stated in the first question.\n\n##### Qualities of a weak answer:\n\n* A 'similar' process to the rest of the industry.\n\nThis alone isn't bad. However, it just means you'll likely get a product that's the same as your competitors.\n\n* A process that focuses on *their* work.\n\nSimilar to the last question, if they are focusing on *their* work and internal system, you know that they optimized for results in *their* process, not yours. An effective system focuses on the end goal *first* then works backward to figure out how to achieve that ‚Äî achieve the best efficiency for YOU, not for them.\n\n* Complex and difficult to explain.\n\nNo truly effective system is complex. If the firm can't explain it simply to you, they don't have an effective system.\n\n##### Qualities of a strong answer:\n\n* Definitive process with clear measurable results.\n\nExact stats, metrics, and processes ensure with a high probability of success for the project.\n\n* Examples of a proven process that worked with previous clients.\n\nA proven process may not strictly necessary. Working through a new system logically can ensure success, especially if your project offers unique scheduling or design challenges.¬†\n\nHowever, a marketplace-tested system adds an extra layer of comfort. Note that price should be adjusted accordingly based on risk. So if it hasn‚Äôt been tested, their cost should be much lower.¬†\n\n* Clear timelines.\n\nMore complex campaigns with more firms involved (particularly who have dependencies on key deliverables) make specific timelines especially important.\n\n#### **3. WHAT'S YOUR STRATEGY FOR THE PROJECT?**\n\nYou would think having a strategy would be more common.¬†\n\nMost firms think they have one. Some firms have one for themselves. Very few firms have one for you and for the biggest picture of the project.¬†\n\n##### Qualities of a weak answer:\n\n* Actually giving a response.\n\nThe challenge with this question lies in an inability to answer it without *knowing the* objectives of the project. Even if the answer seems obvious, a firm cannot make good decisions without the preliminary processes completed. The same way a doctor asks you questions regardless of the apparent symptoms.¬†\n\n##### Qualities of a strong answer:\n\n* Will set up an intentional call to go over it further.\n\nGood firms will have a specific system in place to generate the strategy based on your *specific* project.\n\n#### **4. HOW WILL YOUR SERVICE HELP US LONG-TERM?**\n\nOnce you determine that the firm focuses on making you money, can effectively diagnose your problems, and have a clear process for achieving your goals, you can now ask this ‚Äútrick‚Äù question.¬†\n\nIt catches firms off-guard. Most project requirements don‚Äôt focus on long-term goals - as it‚Äôs not within the scope. However, a good firm becomes great when they can explain how they‚Äôll help long-term. It classifies them as the one you ought to be working with for a long time.¬†\n\nIt signifies that they truly focus on helping *you* and *your* project.¬†\n\n##### Qualities of a weak answer:\n\n* They haven't thought about it.\n\nUnderstand that this is *most* firms. Rarely do firms care about the impact of their work beyond the scope of delivery. If this is the case, ensure you have a system in place internally to ensure the product's utilization within your future touchpoints. E.g. How will the marketing team or the branding team use the renderings?\n\n##### Qualities of a strong answer:\n\n* They'll have real-life case studies.\n\nThis ensures consistency of effective delivery over a broad range of different projects.\n\n* They'll have a separate service in place for this.\n\nAll great firms should have a process in place for post-delivery utilization and optimization. After all, what's the use of creating a phenomenal product if it's not utilized effectively?\n\n‚Äç\n\n##### If they've answered all these questions in a 'strong' fashion, you can be confident that this firm thinks beyond themselves and will be a good investment for you.¬†\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n\n‚Äç\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T14:08:05.997902981Z","tags":null},"/notes/Website-Taxonomy":{"title":"Website Taxonomy","content":"\n*Created*: *2023-03-10*\n*Version*: 1.00\n\n---\n\n# Symbols\n\nüó∫Ô∏è = Database\n\nüìç = Sub Database\n\nüìî = Books\n\nüë§ = People\n","lastmodified":"2023-03-17T14:08:05.997902981Z","tags":null}}
